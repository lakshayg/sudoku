# Sudoku solver
This project solves sudoku puzzles by formulating it as a [boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem).
It uses [minisat](http://minisat.se/) to solve the SAT problem.

## Obtaining the sovler
```
git  clone https://github.com/lakshayg/sudoku
cd sudoku
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
OR
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lakshayg/sudoku
```

## Building the sovler
Go to the project root directory and follow these steps to compile the solver (make sure you are using g++ <s>and not clang</s>)
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
```
This will generate an executable named `main` in the build directory. This is the solver.

## Using the solver
The solver takes a text file as the input. Some sample puzzles are provided in the demo folder. To solve a puzzle, create a text file containing the puzzle. Use `0` for blank cells. An example is shown below:
```
0  0  0  0  0  0  1  9  0
0  0  1  7  0  0  0  0  8
0  4  9  2  0  0  0  6  0
0  0  0  3  0  0  0  0  0
8  0  0  0  0  7  3  0  0
0  0  0  6  0  5  0  0  2
0  8  0  0  0  9  0  0  0
0  0  4  0  0  0  5  0  0
5  0  0  0  0  0  2  1  4
```
Now go into the build directory and use the following command
```
./main <path-to-puzzle-file>
```
This should print out the solved puzzle on the terminal screen.
```
